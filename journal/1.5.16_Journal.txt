Woke up today very unmotivated and tired. Was a struggle to get out of bed. I got to the shop to find only Adam. Judd called in. And like that I am both Medical and Recreational budtender until Joel and Casey come in. 
This one must go straight on. The path is thin and trecherous. It would be too easy to fall off either side and into darkness. 
Re-read the "Litany Against Fear" to help me in these times. 
[I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total oblivion. I will gace my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.]
12:33
The day is progressing almost halfway and I feel like I will make it. Looked ay my bank account today and was double charged for an item and an overdraft fee. They said that (the bank) would take care of it. 
I got a ride home with Joel after smoking with Casey. We blazed three bowls before heading back home. There I found Chris, Kayle, Nick, and Tyler playing Catan. We watched for a few minutes before Emil came over to hang out. She looked very beautiful with her dark lipstick, and I couldn't help but embrace her. And invite her to play a round of Munchkin with me and Joel.
As we began, the game of Catan ended and Chrayle returned to their abode. Two more players for Munchkin! We played two games. Emil left after the first game. We teased each other a little but I may have gone too far. Went to sleep about midnight and sleep to me slowly and restlessly.
