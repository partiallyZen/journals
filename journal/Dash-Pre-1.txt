The Arvad was once a jewel striding accross the great blackness of galactic space. It's facits, both seen and unsee, were innumerable. It's strides, slow and methodical. It's goal, almost unimaginable. 
Now, it sat there. A great spacebeast marooned on this lonely asteroid, lost in the great expanse of the cosmos. 
*Our new home*, Dash thought to himself as he floated in the dim semi-flouressence of his quarters.
"Crew quarters, more like 1/16ths." He said outloud to noone in particular. 
Proceded by a high pitched ping, the lights elluminated as soon as Dash moved his mouth. Morning on the Arvad has begun and his "quarters" were layed bare. A bed, bolted to the wall with his polymer sleep straps, was a twin and barely fit Dash's entirely average figure.

Still harvesting the very last of her husk. More systems shut down every night, never to be run again.

A small terminal nearby blinked one single flash every few seconds. 


crew members shifted, tethered to their bunks.
