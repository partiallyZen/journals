The Arvad was once a jewel striding accross the great blackness of galactic space. It's facits, both seen and unsee, were innumerable. It's strides, slow and methodical. It's goal, almost unimaginable. 
Now, it sat there. A great spacebeast marooned on this lonely asteroid, lost in the great expanse of the cosmos. 
*Our new home*, Dash thought to himself as he floated in the dim semi-flouressence of his quarters.
"Crew quarters, more like 1/16ths." He said outloud to noone in particular. 
Proceded by a high pitched ping, the lights elluminated as soon as Dash moved his mouth. Morning on the Arvad has begun and his "quarters" were layed bare. A bed, bolted to the wall with his polymer sleep straps, was a twin and barely fit Dash's entirely average figure. 
He couldn't imagin that any outlier in width or height would find sleep in the last fleeting bowels of Arvad. But they did, still so many of her children lived within the center of the great corpse. Still harvesting the very last of her husk. More systems shut down every night, never to be run again.
Their movement now brought the din of humanity to his ears. Through the deck to the right of his  bulkhead he heard his neighbor's door open, the clink of his umbi on the railing, and the knock on his door. 
A small terminal nearby blinked one single flash every few seconds. A message that would need to wait for later. Dash slotted his chit into the wall and pressed the overtly blatant coffee button and the number '2'. The karafe played a melody of caffination against it's metal bottom as Dash floated over towards the door. 
Pushing his security command into the bulkside door, Dash enabled the door allowing it to be opened freely. 
"It's Open." Dash stated just moments before the door started to slide open and a... tablet floated through. As Dash craned his head to see if there was anyone attached to the tablet, a woman emerged. Her nose buried halfwat through a tatterd book titled "HMT: The Life Particle by Yasuhiro Oba". The woman seemed to forget that she her umbi was still clipped and as the door closed, she stopped abrubtly running into Dash, tying him up and sending them spinning into the middle of the room. 
crew members shifted, tethered to their bunks.
