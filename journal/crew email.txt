Welcome partiallyZen Corporation Employee! 

We are happy to announce that our funding goal has been reached. 

The Corporation was able to secure more 13+ km² asteroids and one 300+ km² asteroid. Kevbots Run - our original base - has been requisitioned for outer rim work. Albion, partiallyZen Corp's new Adalia HQ, is said to be an asteroid of superior quality in intial scans. A full list of our newly acquired asteroids will be placed below at the bottom of this message. 

Speaking of superior quality, if you are reading this you must be of superior quality as well. You have been directly acquired to lead our premier expedition to Albion as Facility Supervisor. Congratulations on the promotion. We know you are excited for your unpaid internship into the stars!

Provided below is a list of candidates for your potential team. While this is open to be revised by partiallyZen Corp at any time, we know you will take the initiative to reach out to these new crew members. Or should we say, your new FAMILY! 

While we wait for all the smart contracts to be submitted and your existence verified, take time to rest and say your farewell to any loved ones or friends. You will most likely never see them again!
