Today started out very strangely. 

I found myself more than a bit hungover. Wanted to see my sweet Emil, I reached out to her and found her still itter from the night before. I, confused, must have been ignorant of something I drunkenly said. 
So, we fought, yelled, cried, talked. I found myself wishing I could be stronger in these moments. Leave my ego at the door and know that the world is not just what I imagine in my head. But the world is always such a strange mix of half-heard reflections. What Emily thinks, that I think. And what I think about that. yadda yadda...
She came back later to watch Rick & Morty and I saw, for one of the first times, the regenerative nature of love. Like a anenomy, it can retreat in fear but when comforted it can show itself in full beautiful glory. 
I, truthfully, love her to the ends of the Earth and know that we are meant to do great things together. I surely miss her on days we have together but two days until my birthday. One of the best reasons to party.
