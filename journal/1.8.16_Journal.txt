Wake up to the day! Happy Birthday to us. Made it to LT's class for the third year in a row, thanks to help from Emil. She is the best and I love her so much. 
Got to 'The Academy' and met up with L to see her new room. What a great teacher. I feel a small portion different this year, on my laurels and ready for a change that I know is coming. I am very excited for the birthday party tonight. as it seems others are as well. 
The classes are very funny (muy divertido) and the day is progressing well. I find myself enjoying class but the cycle of class everyday and the school atmosphere keeps me from committing fully to teaching as a field. 
Which this one could be a traveling teacher, or something of the like. But I know Emil and I will find something together. Thoughts are on a website based around medical/recreational use of cannabis. 
Had a delicious lunch made by LT. Triple decker PB&J with a tosted PB center. My favorite. The day drones on and I find myself ready to be partying, but also to be with Emily.

Spanish class number two after a lively pride period. This one feels the weight of a teacher and notices how difficult it is to have the energy to do this for a whole day. 
Going to a place with Em, Jim, LT, and Ma after school for BBQ. Something I am definitely looking forward to.
